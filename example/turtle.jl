# Turtle Programming

# ## Introduction
# In this tutorial we will have a look at _Turtle Programming_. In 1967 a general purpose programming language called LOGO was created. The main highlight of this language was turtle graphics. In turtle graphics we have a robot with a pen which draws on a canvas. We can control this turtle using a few commands. The main commands are :
#
# * `forward` : move the turtle forward
# * `turn` : turn the turtle
# * `penUp/penDown` : activate/deactivate the turtle's pen
#
# To get a brief understanding of how _this_ works head over [here](https://rawgit.com/wrschneider99/js-turtle/master/turtle.html).
#
# While Turtle programming generally refers to a 2-D turtle we have a 3-D version available. In the 3-D version we have three types of `turn` available for each of the dimensions of the turtle.
#
# * `pitch`
# * `yaw`
# * `roll`
#
# Let's first start with only operating on a 2-D plane and later we will discuss 3-D.
#
# You need to clear up space for experimentation. Use `setBlocks()` with PiCraft.AIR to clear up space. If you are on the Java edition then it is suggested that you use
# `New World -> Creative -> World Type: Superflat -> Customize -> Presets -> The Void -> Create New World`
# Then we can setup a canvas for drawing as follows:

p = getPos()
setBlocks(p .+ (-50, 0, -50), p .+ (50, 0, 50), Block(35, 15))
# [canvasSetup.png](../docs/src/assets/img/Turtle/canvasSetup.png)
#
# To initialize the turtle:
t = turtle(pos = p)
# Since we are only concerned with the 2 dimensions of the plane we only need a single turn function which will be `yaw`
turn = yaw

move(t, 10)
turn(t, 45) # Note that the angle is in degrees, use `deg2rad(θ)` to convert from radians.
move(t, 10)
t.penBlock = PiCraft.IRON_BLOCK # Change penBlock
move(t, 10)
turn(t, 45)
move(t, 10)
t.penDown = false
turn(t, 90)
move(t, 10)
t.penDown = true
move(t, 10)

# [draw1.png](../docs/src/assets/img/Turtle/draw1.png)
# To reset the canvas and the turtle it can be convenient to define a function

function clrscr(t, p)
    setBlocks(p .+ (-50, 0, -50), p .+ (50, 0, 50), Block(35, 15))
    t.pos = p
end
clrscr(t, p)

# Draw a square

move(t, 10)
yaw(t, 90)
move(t, 10)
yaw(t, 90)
move(t, 10)
yaw(t, 90)
move(t, 10)

# [square.png](../docs/src/assets/img/Turtle/square.png)

# We can also use a 'for loop' for the same
clrscr(t, p)
for i in 1:4
    move(t, 10)
    yaw(t, 90)
end

# Similarly, we can draw a triangle

# Draw a triangle
clrscr(t, p)
for i in 1:3
    move(t, 10)
    turn(t, 120)
end

# Challenge: Figure out how to draw a general polygon using a loop
#
# Solution:
function drawPolygon(t::turtle, n::Integer, l::Real)
    θ = 180 - 360/n
    for i in 1:n
        move(t, l)
        yaw(t, θ)
    end
end

clrscr(t, p)
# Star
for i in 1:5
    move(t, 50)
    turn(t, 144)
end

# [star.png](../docs/src/assets/img/Turtle/star.png)

# We can also make spirals.
#
# Spiral
clrscr(t, p)
for i in 1:10
    move(t, 5*i)
    turn(t, 90)
end

# [spiral1.png](../docs/src/assets/img/Turtle/spiral1.png)

clrscr(t, p)
for i in 1:10
    move(t, 5 + 5*i)
    turn(t, 120)
end

# ## 3-D turtle
# As mentioned earlier instedad of a single `turn` command we have 3 commands, namely `yaw`, `pitch` and `roll`.
#
# [Roll_Pitch_Yaw.JPG](../assets/img/Turtle/Roll_Pitch_Yaw.JPG)
# In essence we have 3 mutually perpendicular axis on the turtle.
#
# * Longitudinal(turtle.direction, points forward) : Roll Axis
# * Lateral : Pitch Axis
# * Vertical(turtle.normal, points downwards) : Yaw Axis
#
# To get the positive rotation direction use the [corkscrew rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule).
#
# Curl your right hand's fingers with the thumb pointing outwards like in a thumbs up position. When your thumb points in the axis vector then the curl direction is the positive rotation direction.
#
# We dont need a canvas to experiment with the 3-D turtle. Reset the world as required.

move(t, 10)
pitch(t, 45)
move(t, 10)
pitch(t, -45)
yaw(t, 90)
move(t, 10)
roll(t, 90)
pitch(t, 90)
move(t, 10)

# [draw2.png](../docs/src/assets/img/Turtle/draw2.png)
#
# We can use the same concepts of the 2-D turtle to draw in 3-D.
#
# Square inclined at 45 degrees

t = turtle(pos = getPos())
pitch(t, 45)
for i in 1:4
    move(t, 10)
    yaw(t, 90)
end

# [squareInclined.png](../docs/src/assets/img/Turtle/squareInclined.png)
#
# Spring
t = turtle(pos = getPos())
R = 20
C = 2*pi*R
for i in 1:720
    move(t, C/90)
    yaw(t, 7)
    pitch(t, 5)
end
