    turtle

A graphics turtle meant to move in all 3-Dimensions. It contains the following fields:

* `pos` : The coordinates of the turtle.
* `direction` : The Roll Axis - direction in which the turtle is facing.
* `normal` : The Yaw axis - direction normal to the turtle's body.
* `penBlock` : The block which will be used to draw.
* `stepSize` : The size of a turtle's step.
* `penDown` : Activation state of `penBlock`.

The default constructor initializes the `turtle` at the player's position,roll axis is the positive x-direction,
with the yaw axis pointing downwards. `penBlock` is gold by default and is activated with the `stepSize` = 0.5
